Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they can be used to identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, if you do this, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Site. For example, our Site uses cookies to make it easier for users to download graphics from the site. We may also use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests through the Site’s interface.
                                        An IP address is used by your computer every time it connects to the Internet, which is why this number can be used by Web sites to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our Site, as part of demographic and profile data (known as “traffic data”), so that such data (such as the Web pages that you request through our Site) can be sent to you. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Webstars.org will not use your IP address to attempt to identify you personally, nor to build a profile concerning who you are and what you search through our Site, otherwise that to provide you with the services and subscriptions that you request through registration or use of the Site.

Cookies in and of themselves do not personally identify users, although they can be used to identify a user’s computer. Most browsers are initially set up to accept cookies. If you prefer, you can set your browser to refuse cookies. However, if you do this, you may not be able to take full advantage of our Site. For example, our Site uses cookies to make it easier for users to download graphics from the site. We may also use cookies to collect demographic and profile data for purposes of delivering content specific to your interests through the Site’s interface.
                                        An IP address is used by your computer every time it connects to the Internet, which is why this number can be used by Web sites to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically collected by our Site, as part of demographic and profile data (known as “traffic data”), so that such data (such as the Web pages that you request through our Site) can be sent to you. We also use your IP address to help diagnose problems with our server and to administer the Site. Webstars.org will not use your IP address to attempt to identify you personally, nor to build a profile concerning who you are and what you search through our Site, otherwise that to provide you with the services and subscriptions that you request through registration or use of the Site.

                            Alain Nguyen and Don Lennox created Webstars to make a positive impact in the world using the search industry, which is currently the second largest industry online after ecommerce. Having been entrepreneurs with a combined experience of over fifty (50) years in technology, they both saw innovative ways to tap into the search industry to power brands with a customer base, to be an extension of their brands/channels and help causes raise more funds online without the need for additional donations from supporters.
 <br /><br />
Don designed, built, and supported data centers for most of his career and built his company to Inc 500.
<br /><br />
Alain has been involved in different industries, ranging from telecommunications, software development, and cybersecurity to online advertising and search throughout the course of over 12 years.
